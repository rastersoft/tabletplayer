A simple media player for tablets, based on MPlayer

WHAT IS?

TabletPlayer is a very simple and lightweight front-end for MPlayer. It just allows to choose a media file and play it. It also allows to rewind, fast-forward and pause, and shows the current time position and the full length of the media. Finally, it also allows to set the volume and the language audio track.
